## Advanced Features

### üîÑ State Management

**Zustand Store Architecture**

The application uses Zustand for global state management with selective persistence:

```typescript
// Persistent State (survives page refresh)
interface PersistentState {
  // Wallet
  address: string | null;
  walletType: 'arweave' | 'ethereum' | 'solana' | null;

  // ArNS Cache
  arnsNamesCache: Record<string, { name: string; logo?: string; timestamp: number }>;
  ownedArnsCache: Record<string, { names: Array<OwnedName>; timestamp: number }>;

  // History
  uploadHistory: UploadResult[];
  deployHistory: DeployResult[];
  uploadStatusCache: Record<string, UploadStatus>;

  // Developer Configuration
  configMode: 'production' | 'development' | 'custom';
  customConfig: DeveloperConfig;

  // JIT Payment Preferences
  jitPaymentEnabled: boolean;
  jitMaxTokenAmount: Record<SupportedTokenType, number>;
  jitBufferMultiplier: number;
}

// Ephemeral State (cleared on refresh)
interface EphemeralState {
  creditBalance: number;
  paymentAmount?: number;
  paymentIntent?: PaymentIntent;
  paymentInformation?: PaymentInformation;
  paymentIntentResult?: PaymentIntentResult;
  promoCode?: string;
  paymentTargetAddress: string | null;
  paymentTargetType: 'arweave' | 'ethereum' | 'solana' | null;
  cryptoTopupValue?: number;
  cryptoManualTopup: boolean;
  cryptoTopupResponse?: TurboCryptoFundResponse;
  showResumeTransactionPanel: boolean;
}
```

**State Actions**
- Wallet: `setAddress`, `clearAddress`
- Balance: `setCreditBalance` (ephemeral)
- ArNS: `setArNSName`, `setOwnedArNSNames`
- Uploads: `addUploadRecord`, `updateUploadStatus`
- Deployments: `addDeploymentRecord`
- Payments: `setPaymentAmount`, `setPaymentIntent`, etc.
- JIT: `setJitPaymentEnabled`, `setJitMaxTokenAmount`, `setJitBufferMultiplier`
- Config: `setConfigMode`, `updateCustomConfig`, `updateTokenMap`, `resetToDefaults`

**Cache Management**
- **Primary ArNS Name**: 24-hour cache per wallet address
  - Stored in `arnsNamesCache` with timestamp
  - Automatic expiration check on lookup
  - Refresh on expiration or manual trigger
- **Owned ArNS Names**: 6-hour cache per wallet address
  - Stored in `ownedArnsCache` with timestamp
  - Manual refresh button available
  - Includes ANT state (processId, target, undernames)
- **Upload Status**: Persistent cache with timestamps
  - Stores API response for each upload
  - Used for status display without re-fetching
- **Balance Information**: Event-driven refresh via `refresh-balance` custom event
- **Upload/Deploy History**: Persistent storage, never expires

### üîî Event System

**Custom Events**

The application uses custom events for cross-component communication:

```javascript
// Refresh Balance Event
// Trigger: After successful payment, credit share, or manual refresh
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('refresh-balance'));

// Listen for balance refresh in components
useEffect(() => {
  const handleRefresh = async () => {
    // Fetch new balance from Turbo SDK
    const balance = await turbo.getBalance();
    setCreditBalance(balance);
  };

  window.addEventListener('refresh-balance', handleRefresh);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('refresh-balance', handleRefresh);
}, []);
```

**Event Handling Patterns**
- Payment success triggers balance refresh across all components
- Upload completion triggers history update
- Deployment completion triggers history and owned names refresh
- Wallet connection triggers balance and ArNS name fetch
- ArNS update triggers owned names cache invalidation

**Event Listeners**
- Registered in useEffect hooks with cleanup
- Debounced where appropriate to prevent excessive API calls
- Error handling for failed event handlers
- Type-safe event data where possible

### üîê Just-in-Time (JIT) Payment System

**Overview**
JIT payments allow users to upload files or deploy sites without manually topping up credits first. The system automatically purchases the exact amount of credits needed using cryptocurrency.

**Implementation Details**

*Supported Networks*:
- **Arweave (ARIO)**: Primary JIT network
- **Ethereum (Base-ETH)**: Base L2 network for lower fees
- **Solana (SOL)**: In development, not fully functional

*Configuration* (via JitPaymentCard component):
```typescript
interface JITConfig {
  enabled: boolean;                    // Global JIT enable/disable
  maxTokenAmount: {                     // Maximum tokens per transaction
    ario: 200,                          // ~$20 worth
    solana: 0.15,                       // ~$22.50 worth
    'base-eth': 0.01,                   // ~$25 worth
  };
  bufferMultiplier: 1.1;                // 10% buffer to prevent failures
}
```

*Upload Flow with JIT*:
1. User selects files, system calculates required credits
2. Check current balance: `creditBalance >= requiredCredits + buffer`
3. If insufficient:
   - Display JIT modal with cost breakdown
   - Show token amount needed (ARIO, SOL or Base-ETH)
   - User confirms auto-top-up
4. Create OnDemandFunding instance:
   ```typescript
   const fundingMode = new OnDemandFunding({
     maxTokenAmount: jitMaxTokenAmount,
     topUpBufferMultiplier: 1.1,
   });
   ```
5. Upload with funding mode:
   ```typescript
   const result = await turbo.uploadFile({
     file: file,
     fundingMode, // Automatically tops up if needed
   });
   ```
6. Transaction completes, balance refreshed

*Deploy Flow with JIT*:
- Same process as upload flow
- Applied to entire folder deployment cost
- Buffer accounts for multiple file uploads
- Manifest creation included in cost calculation

**Token Type Mapping**
```typescript
const jitTokenType = walletType === 'arweave'
  ? 'ario'
  : walletType === 'ethereum'
  ? 'base-eth'
  ? 'solana'
  : walletType; // Default to wallet type
```

**User Experience**
- Opt-in system with persistent preferences
- Clear messaging about auto-top-up
- Cost breakdown before confirmation
- Buffer explained as "safety margin"
- No interruption to upload workflow
- Automatic balance refresh after top-up

**Error Handling**
- Insufficient token balance: Clear error message
- Payment transaction failure: Retry option
- Network errors: Fallback to manual top-up
- User cancellation: Return to upload interface

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

**User-Friendly Error Messages**

The application provides clear, actionable error messages:

*Network Connectivity Issues*:
- "Network connection lost. Please check your internet and try again."
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Offline indicator in header

*Wallet Connection Problems*:
- "Wallet extension not found. Please install Wander wallet."
- "Wallet is locked. Please unlock your wallet and try again."
- "Wrong network. Please switch to [correct network]."
- Link to wallet installation/setup guides

*Transaction Failures*:
- "Transaction rejected by user."
- "Insufficient funds to complete transaction."
- "Transaction failed: [specific error from blockchain]"
- Retry button with fresh transaction attempt

*File Upload Errors*:
- "File too large. Maximum size: [limit]"
- "Invalid file type. Supported types: [list]"
- "Upload failed for [filename]: [specific error]"
- Individual file error tracking with retry per file

*ArNS Errors*:
- "Name not found. Please check spelling and try again."
- "Name already registered by another user."
- "Update failed: Invalid ANT record."
- "Permission denied: You don't own this name."

**Error Recovery Mechanisms**
- **Automatic Retry**: Network errors with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Partial Success**: Continue with successful uploads if some fail
- **State Preservation**: Save form data before error
- **Fallback Options**: Alternative paths when primary fails (e.g., manual top-up if JIT fails)
- **Clear Guidance**: Step-by-step recovery instructions
- **Support Links**: Direct links to relevant documentation

**Error Logging**
- Client-side error logging to browser console (development)
